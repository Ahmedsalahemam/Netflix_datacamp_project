In this project, I will apply the skills in python to solve a real-world data science problem. You’ll press “watch next episode” to discover if Netflix’s movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office", using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.

I will also gain experience in an essential data science skill — exploratory data analysis. This will allow me to perform critical tasks such as manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots by using data.This project in datacamp datascience track
